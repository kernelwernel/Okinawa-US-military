## Context 

This is a project I started because of my university dissertation on the presence of U.S. bases in Okinawa, Japan, and my aim was to integrate cartography with ethnography in the context of Okinawa's history of U.S. occupation. 

The goal of this repository is to provide the best and most reliable source of information on this topic by providing a historical and geographical database that existed from 1945 to 2026 for researchers to rely on.

## Challenges and motivation

I found that many sources have missing bases, inaccurate borders, and conflicting reports. A lot of previously done maps on this topic have their problems as well with the aforementioned issues. Even the official Japanese Ministry of Defense website had missing bases that still exists in the present, not to mention it completely discards historical ones while showing legal borders of control instead of physical fencelines that align with realistic observations.

So to accompany this, I did my best to compile the correct details and discarded the incorrect ones from each source I could find to make it as accurate as possible. 

I spent approximately 150+ hours in total manually mapping the areas while binge listening to Nujabes (10/10 experience btw, would recommend). Although I did lose around 2 days worth of work due to a saving error and I'm probably on some sort of watchlist by now, it was definitely worth it :trollface:

## Mapping methodology

Most of the mapping was done by viewing previous maps to view the general shape and area of the target base, then trace the borders through installations of the fences using a combination of google maps, google streetview, and ArcGIS. 

The satellite imagery was sometimes fuzzy and impossible to view with the human eye, but google maps and ArcGIS both have varying clarity depending on the area and time. The difference in time when it was taken is also a very important detail, because the sun is casting shadows at different angles, and sometimes the fences can be found and identified this way.

(show example here)


## What is included and what isn't
There's many categories that I can classify for the bases mapped:
  1. Fully enclosed within fences
  2. Enclosed with an unfenced coastline
  3. Island territory with no fences and no construction
  4. Designated territory with no fences and no construction (I'll explain below)
  5. Maritime territory

I didn't include the many territories that were "designated" but publicly accessible. For example:

| Mod website | Google streetview | Explanation |
(show examples of this phenomenon with the Ie Jima road and the parking lot in Kadena I think)

The only exception to this is Kume Jima Range because despite being tiny, unfenced, and desolate, it has its own unique entry in the Japanese MoD website unlike the examples I showed above. This is the sole example for the 4th category.
