# Okinawa-US-military

(add map here)

## Context 

This is a project I started because of my university dissertation, and one of the sections is about territorial mappings of US military bases in Okinawa.

I spent approximately 50 hours in total manually mapping the areas while listening to Nujabes (10/10 experience btw). 

While I did lose around 2 days worth of work due to a saving error and I'm probably on some sort of watchlist by now, it was all worth it :clueless:

## Sources

I found that many sources have missing bases, inaccurate borders, and conflicting reports. A lot of previously done maps on this topic have their problems as well with the aforementioned problems. Even the official Japanese Ministry of Defense website had errors such as wrong military base names and designated borders that make no sense whatsoever. 

So to accompany this, I compiled the correct details and discarded the incorrect ones from each source I could find to make it as accurate as possible.

## Mapping methodology

Most of the mapping was done by viewing previous maps to view the general shape and area of the target base, then trace the borders through installations of the fences using a combination of google maps, google streetview, and ArcGIS. 

The satellite imagery was sometimes fuzzy and impossible to view with the human eye, but google maps and ArcGIS both have varying clarity depending on the area and time.

The difference in time when it was taken is also a very important detail, because the sun is casting shadows at different angles, and sometimes the fences can be found and identified this way.
